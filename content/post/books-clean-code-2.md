Profile of a product that is approximately 50k lines, comprised entirely of <200-500 line files.

Details should go from high-level at the top of the file to most detailed at the bottom of the file. Think of it like a newspaper article, with highlights and overview at the start and details at the end. But related concepts should be grouped in a class.

Whitespace & indentation are incredibly useful but should also be used in moderation. Paragraphs are easier than chapters. I've personally been burned by deploying a function that was perfect in every way except for a single missed indentation, which brought our customers down for a day. Probably would have been caught if I had broken the function up into smaller pieces.
