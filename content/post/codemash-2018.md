## Prep work

CodeMash is a midwest developer conference with many interesting talks scheduled over its 4-day span. In planning for 2018, looking at their schedule, debating how to spend my time, I remembered from 2017 that their scheduling app was pretty bad. I decided that this year I would take what I've learned in React over the past year and build something myself.
